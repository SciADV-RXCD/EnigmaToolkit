########## CURRENT ROADMAP ##########
#####################################

Priority: Highest
- Remake the whole GUI (yes seriously, i'm stupid as fuck and idk why i didn't have this idea much earlier, because this is so much cleaner and better)
	-> Make a Home Screen with just buttons for each game/series with it's logo
	-> Each button launches a seperate forms window with the available tools for that game/series
	-> the Home Screen also has the Tool Download button as well as the Documentation button - Documentation button can also be found in each game's window, but directly linking to the specific game's documentation

########## DEATH END RE;QUEST 1 + 2 ##########
- Make 3D Models atleast viewable, idk if i can make them repackable too?
- try to extract audio stuff, maybe?

########## TRILLION ##########
.XWB files can be extracted by unxwb (unxwb.exe -d *FOLDER* ***.xwb)
.XWB files can be extracted WITH FILENAMES like this: (unxwb.exe -d *FOLDER* -b ***.xsb *HEXOFFSET-TO-DECIMAL-FROM-XSB* ***.xwb)
		-> Open the .xsb file in a hex editor, search for the first readable filename/audioname, convert the hex offset to decimal and use that number
.wav files extracted by them can be viewed in VLC or MPV - maybe convert to mp3 with ffmpeg? (ffmpeg -i ***.wav -b:a 192K ***.mp3)?
.pac files are used, same as Neptunia Re;Birth1
